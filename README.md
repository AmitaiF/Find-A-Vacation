# Find Vacation
## What is it?
A WPF system made for a "Mini Project in Windows Systems" course.  
The program is made in .NET environment, and it based on the three-tier architecture.  
The program uses XML files to store it's data and uses multi-threads to handle all the actions (e.g. requests to a remote server).

## What does it do?
Every client can register as a Host or a Guest.  
The system designed so that a Guest can upload to the system a request for vacation, with all of his requirements.  
Clients who registered as Hosts can add their Hosting Units to the system.  
Then, for each Hosting Unit, its owner gets a list with all the Guest Requests that fit this Hosting Unit.  
Now he can offer the Guest to come to his Hosting Unit.  
The Guest can see all the offers, and choose the best for him.
